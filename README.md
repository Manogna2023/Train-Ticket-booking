# Train-Ticket-booking
This project is a frontend prototype of an online Train Ticket Booking System, developed as part of our User Interface Design course. The goal was to design a user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing interface that allows users to search for trains, view available schedules, and book tickets seamlessly.
